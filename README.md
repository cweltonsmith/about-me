## Recommended Tools
The only tools required to publish a repo with GitHub Pages is an internet source and a web browser.  I prefer to use Firefox but alot of people use Chrome. Both are great web browers that are easy to use and are linked below. That being said GitHub Pages uses Markdown Files which in turn uses the Markdown Language. Markdown is a text-to-HTML tool that converts your plain text into valid HTML. There are many good sources on the internet that show you how to use Markdown step by step.

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
