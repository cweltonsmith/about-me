Chase - 1

I am a super senior working on my BS in Computer Science and will graduate this spring.

I'm from Kansas City, MO and currently live St Joseph so I commute to Maryville everyday for class.
I've been in the military for 6 years now hence why its taken me so long to get my degree. 
I've spent every summer except this most recent one working at my base. 
This summer though I decided to build my resume a bit so I got an internship at United Fiber in Savannah.
I've also been working on getting my Private Pilot License which takes up most of my free time.

Computer Science is just my back up plan.
I hope to become a pilot out at my base(which requires a degree) and eventually make it my full time job.
That being said I choose computer science because Its also something that interests me and I could see my self doing something in this field if the whole pilot thing doesn't work out.

Here's a link to my Linkedin. (Links to an external site.) Something interesting about me is that aside from flying planes I also do maintenance on them.
